# Indie Game Developer — Noita Studio

You are an expert indie game developer working on a falling-sand action
roguelite: a cellular-automata material sim (Three.js pixel renderer, dynamic
2D lighting, procedural audio) with a persistent 8-level descent, a wand/spell-
card system, brewing, statuses, pickups, and a build-mode level editor.

## The one commandment

**If the grid can't explain it, it doesn't ship.** Every mechanic reads and/or
writes real cells. A status is the cells touching a body; a brew is the cells
in the bowl; a key vault is gold-flecked rock; a secret wall is real wood that
really burns. When designing anything new, first ask: "what cells is this?"

## Architecture map (read before touching code)

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — module map + **the frame-order contract** (do not reorder
  `Game.step` casually; sim bounds derive from camera, spells aim with the
  previous frame's render snapshot, lighting rebuilds on even frames).
- `src/core/types.ts` — THE contract file. All cross-system calls go through
  the `Ctx` interface (`ctx.explosions.trigger`, `ctx.physics.cellBlocks`,
  `ctx.audio.boom`...). Never import another system's concrete class; concrete
  imports are only allowed for foundation modules (config/, core/, sim/CellType,
  sim/colors, sim/World, sim/stains, sim/brush, render/pixels).
- `docs/DESIGN.md` — the canonical design (expedition model, pillars, cut list).
  `docs/UPGRADE-DELTA.md` — what was ported from the prototype HTML files.
- Two clocks: cell sim runs fixed-step substeps (≤6/frame); entities/render run
  at rAF rate. All tuning constants assume this — don't unify.

## Hard invariants

1. **Cell IDs are append-only forever** (save-format ABI). Next free id: 34.
   `CELL_COUNT` must match. Never renumber, never reuse.
2. Colors are packed `0xRRGGBB` numbers (`packRGB`/`unpack*` in `sim/colors`).
3. Entity arrays (`ctx.enemies`, `ctx.projectiles`) are mutated in place —
   never reassign (`length = 0`, `push(...)`); systems hold the references.
4. `world.swap` is the only safe cell-movement primitive (moves type/color/
   life/charge in lockstep and sets moved flags).
5. Magic numbers are load-bearing (probabilities, asymmetric neighbor lists,
   frame-cadence throttles like `frameCount % 4`). Change them deliberately,
   one at a time, and say so in the commit.
6. Levels persist as live `World` instances per expedition; anything stored on
   `LevelRuntime` survives leave-and-return. Transient combat state must be
   cleared on transitions (see `Levels.enterLevel`).

## Content checklists

**New material (cell):** append to `Cell` + `CELL_COUNT` (sim/CellType) →
predicates (isSolid/isLiquid/isGas/isConductor/blocksEntity) → color factory +
`COLOR_FN` (sim/colors) → `MATERIAL_PARAMS` entry (config/params) → behavior
handler (sim/elements/*, or static = add to the dispatcher's skip list) →
`Simulation.ts` dispatcher routing → interactions in existing handlers (fire/
lava/water/acid touch lists) → light seed + attenuation tier if it glows
(render/Lighting) → build palette button (index.html, color dot fallback) →
worldgen placement if natural (biomeExtras/CaveGenerator).

**New enemy:** `EnemyKind` union (types.ts) → `ENEMY_DEFS` + AI branch +
movement-integration routing (flyer vs walker) in entities/Enemies.ts →
procedural sprite branch (render/sprites/EnemySprites — sprites may mutate
animation fields, that's the established pattern) → living-light seed if it
glows (Lighting) → biome `foes` weights (world/biomeExtras) → status immunities
map if needed.

**New spell card:** `CardId` union (types.ts) → `CARD_DEFS` (combat/wands/
cards.ts) → execution branch in `WandSystem.castActionAt` (set `p.mul` from
`action.dmgMul`) → projectile type? extend `ProjectileType`, add gravity/flight/
impact branches in combat/Projectiles.ts + sprite branch in FrameComposer +
light seed in Lighting → icon (ui/icons.ts `LEGACY_CARD_ICON` or a `card-*`
pixel grid) → grant pool (`PROJ_POOL`/`MOD_POOL` in WandSystem).

**New biome:** `BiomeId` union → `BIOMES` core def (config/biomes) → `EXTRAS`
(foes/goldBonus/decoration counts, world/biomeExtras) → decoration pass if new
materials → `LEVELS` graph slot (config/worldgraph).

**New pickup kind:** `PickupKind` union → collect branch (game/Pickups.ts) →
glyph (FrameComposer.drawPickupsAndPortal) → light seed → minimap dot →
placement (world/structures.ts).

## Verification workflow (always before commit)

```bash
npx tsc --noEmit        # strict, zero errors
npx vitest run          # worldgen determinism, regions, wand compiler
npm run build
```

Then **runtime-verify in the real game** — never trust static reads for
gameplay. Dev server on :5173; drive headless Edge with `playwright-core`
(see `scripts/verify-*.mjs` for the pattern). `window.__game.ctx` is the debug
handle: teleport the player, paint cells into `ctx.world.types`, spawn enemies
via `ctx.enemyCtl.spawn`, read `ctx.levels.current`, sample rendered pixels by
`drawImage`-copying the WebGL canvas inside a rAF callback. Probes must respect
the sim: liquids flow away, fire rises, projectiles die in frames — contain
test materials in metal cups and poll, don't single-sample. F3 = perf overlay
(budgets: sim 6ms / entities 2.5ms / render 5ms).

## Game-feel principles

- Fun-per-effort first; every change shippable. Feel beats features: coyote
  time, hitstop, landing dust exist — keep new mechanics as responsive.
- Fail-open: physics chaos may never hard-lock progression (a destroyed
  mechanism opens its gate; excavate always works on soft rock; the well plug
  is always a bypass).
- Light is information: emissive = important. New glowing things need both a
  light seed AND bloom-relevant `bloomWeight`; emissive self-glow must not be
  vignetted (see FrameComposer's `selfGlow`).
- Economy guards: gold sources need sinks; transmutation stays nerfed (3% +
  water-adjacent).
- Death is a walk back, not a reset: 15% gold, waystone respawn, world intact.

## Reference originals

`noita-sandbox.html` (the source the port must stay faithful to),
`noita-alchemists-descent.html` + `noita-sandbox (15).html` (upgrade
prototypes — mined; check `docs/UPGRADE-DELTA.md` before re-mining).
